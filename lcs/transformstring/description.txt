Given two strings s1 and s2, develop an algorithm to print the positions of the symbols to be swapped to get s2 from s1 with a constraint that symbol in any position ‘p’ can be changed only once. For example, if s1 = ‘abcd’ and s2 = ‘cdab’ then two swaps are required so print 1 3, 2 4. If s1 = ‘abcd’ and s2 = ‘cdba’ then print ‘Not possible’ since the string cannot be transformed by just swapping symbols in a position only once.
